# This Python snippet defines a class `Solution` with a method `minimumLength` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer. 
# The method initializes two pointers `left` and `right` at the start and end of the string respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `left` is less than `right` and the characters at these positions in the string are equal.
# Within the loop, it stores the character at position `left` in the variable `char`. It then increments `left` until it reaches a different character than `char`, and decrements `right` until it reaches a different character than `char`.
# Finally, the method returns the length of the substring between `left` and `right` (inclusive), which represents the minimum length of the string after removing characters from both ends that are the same.

# The time complexity of the `minimumLength` method is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because the method iterates through the string once using 
# two pointers, `left` and `right`, and adjusts them based on the characters encountered.

# For edge cases:
# - If the input string is empty, the method will return 0 because the pointers `left` and `right` are initially set to 0 and -1, so the length between them is 0.
# - If the input string has only one character, the method will return 1 because the pointers `left` and `right` are set to 0 and 0, and the length between them is 1.

# The method can handle strings with special characters as well as alphanumeric characters because it compares characters directly without any restrictions on the character type.

# Regarding whitespace characters in the input string, the method will treat them like any other character. It will consider whitespace characters the same way it considers 
# any other character in the string when determining the minimum length after removing characters from both ends that are the same.
