# This Python snippet defines a class `Solution` with a method `maxFrequencyElements`. The method takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns an integer. 

# Within the method:
# - It initializes a list `freq` with 101 zeros.
# - It initializes `maxF` to 0.
# - It then iterates over each element `x` in the input list `nums`, incrementing the count of `x` in the `freq` list.
# - It updates `maxF` to be the maximum of the current `maxF` and the count of the current element `x`.
# - It initializes `ans` to 0.
# - It then iterates over each frequency `f` in the `freq` list and if the frequency is equal to the maximum frequency `maxF`, it adds that frequency to the answer `ans`.
# - Finally, it returns the total sum of frequencies that match the maximum frequency.

# This code essentially calculates the sum of elements that have the maximum frequency in the input list `nums`.
