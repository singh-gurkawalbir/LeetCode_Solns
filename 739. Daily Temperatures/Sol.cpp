// Intuition
// The goal is to find the number of days one has to wait until a warmer day for each given day's temperature. This can be efficiently solved using a stack.

// Approach
// Initialize an array results to store the number of days until a warmer day for each day's temperature.
// Initialize an empty stack to keep track of indices.
// Iterate through each temperature in the array.
// While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index on the top of the stack:
// Update the result for the index at the top of the stack with the difference between the current index and the index on the top of the stack.
// Pop the index from the stack.
// Push the current index onto the stack.
// After the iteration, the results array contains the number of days until a warmer day for each given day.
// Complexity
// Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of temperatures.
// Space complexity: O(n), as the stack can have at most n elements.

public:
    std::vector<int> dailyTemperatures(std::vector<int>& temps) {
        std::vector<int> results(temps.size());
        std::stack<int> stack;
        /// UPVOTE !
        for (int i = 0; i < temps.size(); i++) {
            while (!stack.empty() && temps[stack.top()] < temps[i]) {
                results[stack.top()] = i - stack.top();
                stack.pop();
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }

        return results;
